## How to play

The player will flip one card over to reveal the symbol on the card. Another card is turned over to try and match the symbol of the second card to the first card. If the cards match, they stay revealed. If the cards do not match, they are flipped face down. The player continues to flip two cards at a time to try match symbols. The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## What to expect

The player will be timed and shown how many moves it took to complete the game. Stars will be given in accordance to how well you did in the game with regards to how many moves it took for you to complete.
